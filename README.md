# Fe Builders Challenge starter

A starting point for the [Fe Builders Challenge](https://fe-lang.org/contest/):
three weeks to build something with [Fe](https://fe-lang.org) and compete for
$5,000 in prizes. It contains a small Fe project with tests, a CI workflow, and
a template for your final README.

The [contest page](https://fe-lang.org/contest/) has the full details and the
rules.

## Get started

1. Install Fe 26.5 or later. Any Fe release from 26.5.0 on is allowed for the
   contest; see the [installation guide](https://fe-lang.org/getting-started/installation/).

   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argotorg/fe/master/feup/feup.sh | bash -s -- --version v26.5.0
   ```

2. Clone this repository into a new project and point it at your own GitHub
   repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fe-lang/builders-challenge-starter my-project
   cd my-project
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<you>/<your-project>.git
   ```

3. Run the tests and build the contract:

   ```sh
   fe test
   fe build
   ```

4. [Register your project](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehDUUbqfQt67Ecy21zIsOFN7pp4orx9Ko9DKCWcDkjhEUVBg/viewform)
   by November 17. Your idea can still change after you register. You will
   receive your project ID and a private submission link by email.

## What's inside

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `fe.toml` | The ingot manifest. Rename the ingot to fit your project. |
| `src/lib.fe` | A time-locked vault contract: accounts deposit ETH and withdraw it after a lock period. |
| `src/tests.fe` | Tests that deploy the vault and call it. |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Checks formatting and runs the tests with Fe 26.5.0 on every push. |
| `SUBMISSION.md` | A template for the README the jury reads. |
| `LICENSE` | Apache-2.0. |

The vault is only an example. Replace it with your own project; it does not
need to be a contract. Native programs, libraries, and developer tools are
welcome too, as long as the core technical contribution is written in Fe. The
[Fe guide](https://fe-lang.org/getting-started/what-is-fe/) is a good place to
start.

## Before you submit

Submit by **November 24, 2026, at 23:59 UTC** with the personal submission link
from your registration email. Your submission needs:

- [ ] A public GitHub repository with an OSI-approved license. You can keep the
      Apache-2.0 `LICENSE` or replace it with another OSI-approved license.
- [ ] The full commit SHA the jury should review.
- [ ] Your project manifest (`fe.toml`) and the exact Fe version you used.
- [ ] Reproducible build and test instructions, and automated tests that fit
      your project.
- [ ] A README covering the problem, your approach, the architecture, and
      limitations. Start from `SUBMISSION.md`.
- [ ] A one-sentence pitch and one Fe-specific technical highlight.
- [ ] A short demo: a video, screenshots, or a reproducible CLI example.
- [ ] A declaration of pre-existing work, reused third-party code, and AI
      assistance.

You can submit again before the deadline; the latest valid submission counts.
